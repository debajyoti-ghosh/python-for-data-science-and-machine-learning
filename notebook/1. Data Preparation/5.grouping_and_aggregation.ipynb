    "# Grouping and Aggregation in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping and aggregation are fundamental techniques in data analysis. They allow us to explore and summarize datasets by breaking them into meaningful subgroups and then computing statistics for each subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Understand what grouping means conceptually\n",
    "- Load a real dataset (`mtcars`)\n",
    "- Group data by a categorical column\n",
    "- Apply aggregation functions (mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example follows the explanation from the video transcript and demonstrates **grouping data by column index using pandas**."

    "- Explore natural subgroups in your data\n",
    "- Compare subsets of data\n",
    "- Identify patterns and trends\n",
    "- Focus analysis on specific categories\n",
